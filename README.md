## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing U.S. medical insurance costs. The objective is to explore and understand the factors that influence medical charges, build predictive models to estimate these charges, and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Dataset Structure

- `age`: Age of the individual
- `sex`: Gender of the individual (male/female)
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight
- `children`: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance
- `smoker`: Smoking status of the individual (yes/no)
- `region`: Residential region in the U.S. (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)
- `charges`: Medical charges billed by insurance

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration**: Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.
3. **Descriptive Statistics and Data Visualization**: Generate summary statistics and visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships.
4. **Specific Analyses**: Perform detailed analyses on individual factors such as age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and region to understand their impact on medical charges.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Build regression models to predict medical charges based on the available features.
6. **Conclusion and Recommendations**: Summarize the findings and provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
